## Tips to make this README live on your profile
1. Create a new repository named exactly: `Rootexploiter5` (your GitHub username).
2. Add this README.md as the repository README (replace placeholders: emails, links, repo names).
3. Pin the repositories you want to showcase on your profile (Profile → Customize your pins).
4. Add/replace badges (shields or images) with your actual links or certification badges.
5. Keep one short line as your GitHub bio (profile top):
   - Example bio (one line): "B.Tech Cybersecurity • Certified Penetration Tester • VAPT • CEH v13 Student • ICET Cyber Wing Lead"
6. Regularly update Projects & What I’m Learning as you finish labs/certifications.

---

If you want, I can:
- customize a shorter one-line GitHub bio for the profile header,
- create suggested README variants (concise vs. detailed),
- or generate badges (shields) with exact links for your certificates and socials — tell me which links/certificates to include and I’ll insert them.
